		Required Setup
	</h1>

	<p>
		To use HashOver you first need to change a few settings that control
		important features, such as email notifications, data encryption, and admin
		comment moderation. To do this you need to edit the
		<code>/hashover/backend/classes/secrets.php</code> file and fill in the
		following information...
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>
			<code>$notificationEmail</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			An email address. HashOver will send email notifications to this email
			address whenever users post comments on your website and when the users
			reply to each other. This should be an email address you want to send
			new comment notifications to.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$noreplyEmail</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			A noreply email address. When users reply to each other HashOver will
			send an email notification to the email address stored in the comment
			being replied to. This setting controls what email address you want set
			as the <code>Reply-To</code> address in reply email notifications sent
			to normal users. This should be an e-mail address that is not monitored,
			where the mail is potentially not even stored. This can be set to the
			same address as the <code>$notificationEmail</code> instead, allowing
			the user to reply to you by replying to the email notification. However,
			this would expose your email address to everyone who receives an email
			notification, which is something you might not want.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$encryptionKey</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			An encryption key, for encrypting and decrypting sensitive user data in
			comments such as email addresses and passwords. It can contain text of
			any length, but its best to keep the value alphanumeric. This setting
			is case-sensitive. You should think of this as a password, make it
			something hard to guess but easy for you to remember, in case the
			<code>secrets.php</code> file gets replaced with the default at some
			point, for example when updating HashOver to a newer version.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$adminName</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			The name for the Admin user. This does not need to be a user that
			exists on your server, it is completely HashOver-specific. This setting
			is case-sensitive. Anyone who uses this name with the correct password
			when they login will gain Admin rights, they will be able to moderate
			the comments, edit, delete, and approve pending comments.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$adminPassword</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			The password for the Admin user. This setting is case-sensitive.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id="sql-setup">
		SQL Setup
	</h2>

	<p>
		The following settings are optional, but required if you plan to store
		comments in a MySQL database or any other SQL server supported by
		<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php" target="_blank">PDO</a>
		that uses MySQL compatible statement syntax. Below is the information you
		need to fill in before HashOver will connect to your database.
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>
			<code>$databaseType</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies what kind of SQL database HashOver stores the comments
			in, either <code>sqlite</code> or <code>mysql</code>. Other databases might
			work as well, but they are not officially supported or tested.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$databaseName</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies different things based on the database type. For
			SQLite it serves as the name of the database file stored under
			<code>/hashover/comments</code>, for MySQL it serves as the name of an
			existing database in the server.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$databaseHost</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies where to find the SQL server. It is a regular
			host, either a local hostname or an IP address, normally
			<code>localhost</code>, but it can be a remote host as well. This
			setting is not used for SQLite.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$databasePort</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies which port the SQL server is running on. For MySQL
			this is normally <code>3306</code>, but it can be any port and is normally
			unique to a specific SQL server. This setting is not used for SQLite.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$databaseUser</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies which user to connect to the SQL server as.
			Unlike the Admin user, this setting needs to be a user that exists on
			the SQL server, often this is the <code>root</code> user as they have
			permission to write to any database. Connecting to the SQL server as
			<code>root</code> is not recommended, as it is a security
			vulnerability. Instead, if you can, you should create a new user to use
			with HashOver, one that has their own unique password and permission to
			write to the database. This setting is not used for SQLite.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$databasePassword</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies the password for the SQL server user described
			above. This setting is not used for SQLite.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$databaseCharset</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			The character set of the comments being stored in the database. Set to
			<code>utf8mb4</code> when using MySQL or MariaDB (to support emojis).
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id="smtp-setup">
		SMTP Setup
	</h2>

	<p>
		The following settings are optional, but required if you plan to send
		email notifications through an SMTP server, such as Gmail. By default,
		HashOver uses the built-in email support in PHP, which uses sendmail on
		GNU/Linux and Mac OS. This may cause problems with some Internet Service
		Providers (ISP), hosting providers, and certain server configurations.
		When this happens you may need to send email notifications through an
		SMTP server. Below is the information you need to fill in before you can
		send email notifications through an SMTP server.
	</p>

	<p>
		On Windows, PHP's sendmail uses SMTP by default, so the following
		settings should not need to be changed on Windows, but if you encounter
		problems, you might try using HashOver SMTP instead of sendmail.
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>
			<code>$smtpHost</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies the SMTP server, for example
			<code>smtp.gmail.com</code>.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$smtpPort</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies the SMTP server port number, commonly
			<code>465</code>. The port number depends on the type of encryption
			being used, but it can be anything. Please consult your SMTP server
			host for proper configuration.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$smtpCrypto</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies the type of encryption to use when connecting
			to the SMTP server. The SMTP server must support the specified
			encryption. The most common encryption type is <code>ssl</code>.
			Please consult your SMTP server host for proper configuration.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$smtpAuth</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies whether the SMTP connection is encrypted, which
			is commonly the case.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$smtpUser</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies the user to connect to the SMTP server as.
			Unlike the Admin user, this setting needs to be a user that exists on
			the SMTP server. For example, if you're sending email through the Gmail
			SMTP server, this setting would be your Gmail account username.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<code>$smtpPassword</code>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This setting specifies the password for the SMTP server user described above.
		</dd>

	<h1 id="troubleshooting">
		Troubleshooting
	</h1>

	<p>
		To begin with, at the bare minimum you want to ensure your server has PHP
		installed, since HashOver is written in the PHP scripting language. PHP has a
		long history with many versions, but HashOver is written with backward
		compatibility in mind, so the minimum PHP version supported is 5.3.3. HashOver
		does not need to be installed like normal software, the files can be downloaded
		and used as-is. HashOver does not require any specific server configuration
		changes. With this in mind, there are very few ways a setup can go wrong.
	</p>

	<h2 id="file-permissions">
		File permissions
	</h2>

	<p>
		HashOver needs to write various data to various files and directories, so
		all of the HashOver files should be owned by the user your server is
		running as, normally this is the <code>www-data</code> user. It is
		particularly important that the directories <code>/hashover/config</code>
		and <code>/hashover/comments</code> be owned by this user. Alternatively,
		these directories can be given permissions <code>0777</code> which grants
		full read and write access to all users. This is generally seen as a
		security vulnerability, so you should avoid doing this if at all possible.
	</p>

	<h2 id="required-modules">
		Required modules/compilation
	</h2>

	<p>
		HashOver does not depend on any third-party libraries or frameworks,
		especially not any other PHP-based software. Although most PHP installations
		include everything HashOver requires by default, depending on your setup
		you may need to install some modules/extensions and/or ensure PHP was
		compiled with support for the following modules.
