Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2015-02-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* NOTICE:

	Do not preserve your "settings.php" file.

	You will need the new version to take advantage of the new and changed 
	features listed below. Not using the new version will cause potentially 
	harmful behavior, errors, and PHP error/warning messages that will 
	in-turn cause JavaScript syntax errors.

	It is completely safe to simply move the values from your old 
	"settings.php" file into the new version. We no longer store settings 
	in an array, so all that is needed is for the new variables to exist.


* Structure of data storage has changed

	The structure of how comments are stored has changed a bit. Notably the 
	"passwd" field is stored as proper "password" now. Unfortunately this 
	means all old comments willn't be editable unless converted to the new 
	structure. For which I have a script for anyone interested.

	Please note that the data format storage structure will most definitely 
	change more, and do so a few more times in the future. However, the 
	changes should be minimal from version 2.0 onward, and in the event 
	that there are big changes, 2.x releases will have backward 
	compatibility. As will 2.0 to 1.0.


* Preliminary support for SQLite as a data storage format.

	It's very early support, it shouldn't be considered stable nor secure. 
	It should be stable and secure by release, or be removed.

	As I expected, SQLite isn't showing any better performance than XML nor 
	JSON. Indeed, to the contrary, SQLite performs worse than XML, and 
	especially worse than JSON. SQLite causes the script to use more memory 
	and it appears to be that as the number of comments for any given page 
	grows, the load time for every page also increases.


* Added ability to "Dislike" comments. Allowing Reddit-style comment voting.

	Before this change comments could only be liked, and then unliked, a 
	comment's popularity was decided only by people who like the comment 
	(as to agree with it), while people who dislike a comment (as to 
	disagree with it) had no power in its popularity.

	The sort "By Likes" method remains in descending order, but is now 
	implemented by the number of likes minus the number of dislikes.

	Using CSS, anyone should be able to choose how to present the 
	Like/Dislike functionality to users, whether it's presented as 
	"Voting", Thumbs Up/Down, or even heart/broken heart. In addition, 
	disliking can be disabled to allow the old behavior of liking comments 
	in a "Favorite"-esque manner, à la Tumblr and Twitter.


* Added comment thread metadata files.

	Stored in `hashover/pages/.metadata` and 
	`hashover/pages/<page>/.metadata` these files serve as a way to 
	retrieve information about the page and comment thread, such as the 
	original page title and URL, as well as the status of thread and a list 
	of an adjustable number of the most recent comments.


* Moved comment parsing regular expressions into JavaScript.

	The regular expressions for automatic URL links, embedded images, and 
	comment clean-up, are now implemented in JavaScript via ".replace()" 
	rather than in PHP via "preg_replace()" and "preg_replace_callback()" 
	functions. This helps improve performance by delegating those tasks to 
	the client-side (web browsers).


* Added optional comment break point.

	By "break point" I mean only a adjustable number of comments will be 
	displayed (default 3) and then a link reading "Show X Other Comments" 
	will be displayed, which after clicked will show the other comments.

	It isn't implemented as efficiently as I'd like, as right now all it 
	does is set the necessary HTML element class name that will hide the 
	comments (or grey/blur them out, whatever you want to do to them via 
	CSS), this means the comments are still being read and parsed by the 
	server, and loaded by the browser just not being displayed.

	Some -- meaning me -- would say that's fine, as the idea of a break 
	point is to restrict the number of comments being displayed when the 
	thread is very long, and the enduser should be not be burdened by 
	waiting for secondary resources to load as would be the case if the 
	comments were loaded asynchronously via AJAX. However, I do understand 
	the benefits of only reading, parsing and loading the rest of the 
	comments once the user has actually requested them.

	This feature will be improved to include that kind of functionality.


* Added threaded versions of each comment sorting method.

	The new sorting methods leave comments threaded, that is to say the 
	comments are sorted but their replies are unaffected, this for example, 
	allows people to sort "By Commenter" and read each commenter's 
	conversations (the replies) in regular order.

	This change is not final, pending discussion as to whether any make 
	sense to users, they will either be kept in the form of new sort 
	options under the "Threaded" label in the dropdown menu, replace the 
	some of the unthreaded sorting methods or all be removed.


* "javascript-mode.php" sets HTTP header to disable/expire browser cache.

	In JavaScript mode, HashOver now tells the browser to disable/not set, 
	or expire the cache of the JavaScript output so that the user actually 
	receives the newest JavaScript content. It's very important for 
	JavaScript that is dynamically generated not to be cached by web 
	browsers, because depending on what the user is doing, the JavaScript 
	output might not always be the same.

	For example:

	    If the browser loads a cached version of the JavaScript after a 
	    user posts a comment, the user will not see their comment unless 
	    they force a uncached refresh on their browser. Although, sometimes 
	    that's not enough to actually get the new file.

	    The same thing applies after a user clicks "Login". They will not 
	    appear to be logged in, since HashOver needs to generate one kind 
	    of JavaScript when the user is logged out and a different 
	    JavaScript when the user is logged in.

	    Also, when editing or deleting a comment, if the cached JavaScript 
	    is loaded, after saving their edit the user will see the old 
	    comment, not the edited version of their comment.


* Changes towards unifying JavaScript and PHP modes.

	`json_encode()` is now used to create the necessary JavaScript comment 
	objects, this means the `$hashover` variable is no longer a string in 
	JavaScript mode (it's an array in both modes), and there's now less 
	differing work between the two modes.

	The "Edit" and "Reply" links now use PHP mode's href attributes in both 
	modes, that is to say they always point to "?hashover_edit=<permalink>" 
	and "?hashover_reply=<permalink>", respectively, instead of "#". 
	Necessary code has been added to run the respective functions when 
	these URL queries are set. This allows people to middle-click or 
	right click->Open Link in New Tab and actually get the desired form in 
	JavaScript mode, which wasn't possible before.

	These are small changes, but they're necessary first steps towards 
	unifying the JavaScript and PHP modes once again. The two modes should 
	be unified before 2.0's released, or be further separated.


* "Login" fields no longer show after posting a comment or logging in.

	Basically logging in means something now.

	There is now a single cookie used for login specific functions such as 
	showing the "Edit" link and hiding the "Like"/"Dislike" links.

	The "Name", "Password", "E-mail Address", and "Website" fields are now 
	hidden when the user is logged in, however, they still show when 
	editing a comment, since the information is useful there.


* Added optional animated loading GIFs.

	When the JavaScript loading is deferred it can be useful to display a 
	loading GIF, however, deferred JavaScript loading is about their only 
	intended use. HashOver should never execute slowly enough to require or 
	allow a loading image or message of any kind to be displayed, as 
	HashOver's total execution time -- with one thousand comments -- should 
	be in the tenths of a second. These loading GIFs are just temporary, 
	improvements are welcomed and customization is encouraged, especially 
	to fit them into the theme of your website.


* Added files:

	hashover.js,
	hashover/hashover.php,
	hashover/scripts/api,

Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2014-05-14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Custom encryption algorithm removed in favor of Blowfish and Mcrypt.

	IMPORTANT NOTICE: Previous user e-mails and passwords no longer usable.

	Users will NOT be able to edit any comments they posted before this 
	change. Also, users will NOT be notified of replies and your server 
	may complain of e-mail delivery failures for any replies to comments 
	posted before this change.

	I've written a converter that will decrypt the old e-mail addresses 
	and convert them to the new mcrypt format so that user comments 
	posted before this change will still notify the poster of replies. 
	However, passwords are always stored as irreversible hashes, and 
	thus are LOST FOREVER.

	The encryption method shouldn't change much after the official release 
	of version 2.0. Breaking user functionality like comment editing and 
	reply notifications should not happen again.


* Complete removal of Identi.ca support.

	Rationale:

	No one used it. I don't foresee anyone using it.


* Added files:

	hashover/scripts/displaycomments.php,
	hashover/scripts/spamcheck.php,
	hashover/scripts/cookies.php,
	hashover/scripts/statistics.php.

	"spamcheck.php" contains new code for spam checking against a local 
	database, and improved code for spam checking against a remote 
	database. Both use databases provided by stopforumspam.com.


* Deleted files:

	hashover/scripts/secrets.php,
	hashover/scripts/global_variables.php,
	hashover/scripts/parse_comments.php,
	hashover/scripts/deletion_notice.php.

	Rationale:

	They contained little code, too little to warrant their own files. I 
	merged the code into "settings.php", "hashover.php" and 
	"displaycomments.php", respectively.


* Moved code towards a Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

	Rationale:

	HashOver's codebase will continue to grow and become more complex over 
	time, an Object Oriented Programming paradigm allows for cleaner and 
	more readable code, less code redundancy, better performance, 
	deprecates use of global variables and doesn't pollute the namespace 
	of PHP applications implementing HashOver as much.

	For anyone curious as to why the codebase is so ugly and procedural, 
	let me answer with two numbers and an acronym... "PHP 5.2, 2009", the 
	year and version of PHP I started HashOver on. PHP 5.2 didn't have true 
	anonymous functions nor decent Object Oriented Programming support, and 
	the following years didn't see PHP versions 5.3 and up become widely 
	adopted, unfortunately. At this point the code has merely been moved 
	into classes, there is probably still some redundant code and one or 
	two global variable statements. This will improve over time.


* Preliminary support for JSON as a data storage format.

	It's very early support, it shouldn't be considered stable nor secure. 
	It should be stable and secure by release, or be removed. I've now ran 
	real speed tests of using JSON vs. XML, and the results were just as I 
	had calculated, see: https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/32


* In PHP mode when editing or replying to a comment users are now kicked down 
  to the respective forms instead of to the top of the comment.

* Many minor changes to accommodate said and following changes.
* Moved input and button background images into single file.
* Added SVG images, which are optional but used by default on mobile devices.
* Cookies set over HTTPS connections are now only sent over HTTPS connections.
* All settings are now in an array to reduce the number of variable definitions.
* Spam checking now only performed when writing a comment.
* Now using placeholder attribute instead of JavaScript onFocus and onBlur.
* Made order of form input attributes consistent (type->name->title->value).
* Changed default name, avoiding mention of GNU/Linux, FOSS and developer terms.
* Wrapped "Popular Comments" in a <div> tag to aid in styling.
* "cmtclass" no longer set unless the comment is a reply.
* Renamed "urlwork.php" to "setup.php".
* Improved "read_comments" function.

* Minor language locale improvement.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2014-03-27
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* When "$icons" variable is set to "no", avatar icons no longer show in reply 
  and edit forms. In the primary form a comment number is displayed instead.

* Many CSS changes to facilitate theming, like comment count and page title.
* Many JavaScript changes to accommodate CSS changes.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2014-03-25
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Official mark of version 1.0!

* All necessary files (source code and images) are now available via:

	ZIP archive: http://tildehash.com/hashover.zip
	GitHub: https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover

* Please commit your changes to GitHub and make sure to read the GitHub page 
  carefully for coding guidelines and copyright information.

* Added new comment sorting feature with five sorting methods:

	In Order
	In Reverse Order
	By Commenter
	By Date (newest first)
	By Likes

* Locale support, only three languages supported right now: English, Spanish, 
  and Japanese. More languages will be added, those three are simply the ones 
  of which I have at least some knowledge. More, further, and better 
  translations are welcome and appreciated.

* Individual IP addresses can now be blocked by adding them one per line to a 
  file called "blocklist.txt" in the "hashover" directory. In addition to that, 
  if the variable "$spam_IP_check" is set to 'php', 'javascript', or 'both' a 
  visitor's IP address will be checked against stopforumspam.com's database.

* E-mail notifications per comment can now be disabled by unchecking the 
  "Subscribe" checkbox in the "Edit Comment" form.

* Added administration support for deletion and editing of all comments. Set 
  the "$admin_nickname" and "$admin_password" variables in the "secrets.php" 
  file to appropriate values. Read the "IMPORTANT" notice carefully.

* Many, many major changes to accommodate said and following changes.
* The script has been split into multiple files in "hashover/scripts" directory.
* Removed all JavaScript from PHP-mode (except code for liking a comment).
* "Reply" and "Edit" forms are now part of the dynamically generated HTML.

* Added "Login" button. It simply sets the necessary cookies that allow users 
  to edit, delete, and (un)subscribe to/from email notifications.

* Removed Jeremiah Stoddard as secondary copyright holder since his 
  contributions are no longer present in the current codebase, or rather, the 
  codebase has changed enough that he would have no legal precedent to claim 
  ownership any longer. Not that I expect any trouble.

* Fixed bug that caused a comment to become uneditable after you post another 
  comment with a different e-mail address as the last. Cause: conditions to 
  display the "Edit" link were based on a name+e-mail+password scheme.

* Renamed "comments.php" to "hashover.php".
* Renamed "comments" directory to "hashover".
* Moved code for automatic links and embedded images out of "write_comments.php"
* Avatar icons that fail to load now get same style as when icons are disabled.
* Temporarily disabled Identi.ca avatar support (see avatars.php) for why.
* Added "reply" to "cmtdiv" CSS class elements to control how replies look.
* Added "nickname" and "likes" to RSS feeds for use as API.
* Removed name and horizontal row from RSS descriptions.
* Now checks PHP version, fails if not 5.3.3 or higher.
* Improved how comment deletion notices are handled.
* Changed format of changelog.
* Minor CSS changes.
* Minor bug fixes.

Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2013-03-18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed bug causing "@username@identica" names to loss "@identica" when editing.
Fixed bug causing all "@" symbols to be removed from names.

Major changes to how HTML output is handled, most HTML has been moved 
into "/comments/templates/default.html", allowing for multiple comment 
styles and easy customization of HTML output and overall layout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"comments.css" link tag no longer added to head if one already exists.

Applied patch by Solomon Peachy


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-10-29
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changed script execution time into JavaScript comment.
Fixed bug allowing external script usage via "canon_url".


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-10-07
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many minor bug fixes.
Many major CSS changes.
Code clean-up, some variable name changes.
Avatar icon URLs added to RSS feed, allowing RSS feeds to act as an API.
Major "Edit" form redesign, editing "Name", "E-mail" and "Website" now allowed.
Comments only containing newlines and/or spaces are now treated as empty.
Now removing trailing newlines and spaces from comments before writing.
RSS feed "link" element now automatically added to page head element.
Fixed bug causing trailing newline when editing a comment.
Twitter/Identi.ca at-handles no longer part of name links.
Improved "<code>" tag method HTML character escaping.
CSS added to style "<pre>" and "<code>" tags.

Fixed bug causing "GET" requests to affect the file including "comments.php". 

	Explanation:

		File "phphome.php" includes "comments.php", like this:
			<?php $mode = 'php'; include("comments.php"); ?>

		Someone visits "phphome.php?rss=http://website.com/", the 
		RSS feed XML would be output on "phphome.php". Similar was 
		true for "phphome.php?count_link=http://website.com/".

Added loop to remove unwanted URL queries from comment directory names.

	Explanation:

		Add unwanted URL queries, one per line, to a file called 
		"ignore_queries.txt" under the "comments" directory.

		Adding just a query name without a value will remove the 
		query from comment directory names no matter what its value 
		is. Adding a query name with a value (name=value) will only 
		remove that specific query with that specific value from 
		comment directory names.

Content no longer written to document using JavaScript "document.write".

	Explanation:

		All content is now placed into the new "show_cmt" variable 
		and then written via "getElementById("hashover").innerHTML". 
		This allows the script to be deferrable (JavaScript 'defer' 
		tag), which means the script executes after the page is done 
		loading; a desirable behavior for some use cases.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-10-06
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major redesign of reply form and "Like", "Edit", and "Reply" buttons.

Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-07-12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Applied patches by InaTux Computers. No changelog, so I'll do my best 
to list what has been changed.

	Comment replies no longer stored in sub-directories, now stored in 
	the same directory and named as <parent comment>-<reply number(s)>.

	Rationale: Solves a permissions bug where sub-directories aren't 
		   owned by a user who has permission to write to them.

		   Only a single directory is read. Making it faster.

		   Generating permalinks is as simple as:
		   #c<preg_replace('/-/', 'r', basename($file, '.xml'))>

		   Easier to read a comments tread via filenames.

	Comment threads now stored in "/comments/pages/<page URL>".
	Separated like functionality into "like.php" script.
	Many, many minor changes to accommodate said and following changes.

	Many "\n" newlines replaced with "PHP_EOL". This helps JavaScript 
	and HTML output look the same across different server platforms.

	"like.php", "avatars.php" and "secrets.php" moved into new 
	"scripts" directory. All images moved into new "images" directory.

	Fixed bug causing "Like" link to only be displayed when an 
	"E-mail Address" cookie is set. Anyone who hadn't commented yet 
	couldn't see the "Like" link.

	Renamed a few variables.
	Added a few code comments.
	Replaced `$fsroot_dir` variable with `chdir()`.
	All mentions of "comments.php" in actual code removed.
	Separated "Default Settings" variables from URL cleaning code.
	Moved "Default Settings" variables back to the top of the code.
	Added more robust handling of "secrets.php" file inclusion.
	Added error message upon failed "secrets.php" file inclusion.
	Updated list of files to download in installation note.
	Spaced out some code structure for better readability.
	Separated deletion notice out into new "deletion_notice" function.
	Reworked handling of deleted comments.

	"All that, and a toilet!"

Added code to escape HTML tags inside <code> tags.
Added <code> tag to accepted HTML.
Fixed serious bugs.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2011-21-08
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added the "endtags" function for counting the number of open and closing HTML 
tags, if the number of open and closing HTML tags aren't the same it adds as 
many closing tags as necessary for each to the end of the file. Ensuring that 
tags left unclosed by a commenter won't affect the rest of the page. The 
function only closes accepted HTML tags, as that's all that's necessary.

Fixed a bug that caused the "Options" link to be displayed even when 
the options were displayed or were never hidden upon first time use 
or due to disabled/unaccepted cookies.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2011-20-08
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug that allowed anyone to use a blank password to delete any comment 
if a password wasn't given when the target comment was posted (thanks "Outis").

when the comment was posted. Subsequently added necessary JavaScript code.

by specifying the title in the <script> tag via the "pagetitle" URL query.

Fixed a bug that caused a blank name if the "Website" field was disabled.

Fixed a bug that caused a message "You will not receive notification of 
replies to your comment without supplying an e-mail" to appear even if the 
"Email" field is disabled.

Now if all fields are disabled the "Options" link displays a message reading: 
"All Additional Options Disabled."


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-12-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug that caused JavaScript syntax errors if an encrypted password 
contained a quote.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-12-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changed code indention from spaced to tabbed.
Changed "Name" field to "Nickname".
Changed "Password (?)" field to "Password (Optional)".

Moved password field so as to appear right after the "Nickname" field, this 
way web browsers will store the "Name" field as username and the "Password" 
field as password, as opposed to "Website" being stored as the username.

Delete field is now auto-filled.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-12-03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merged the two occurring RecursiveDirectoryIterator classes. This should 
make the comment system slightly more efficient as it will no longer read 
the "/comments" directory twice.

Renamed the password input fields' names stored in each comment file to fix 
a bug where the decrypted password would be saved to the comment file.

Renamed the "count_comments" function to "read_comments".


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added functionality to display only the comment count by setting the 
"display" URL query to the page filename.

Added information about said functionality to the installation note.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-06 to 2010-11-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altered the "count_comments" function to use RecursiveDirectoryIterator and 
merged Jeremiah Stoddard's modifications with the "count_comments" function.

Added functionality to show a "This file has been deleted" note on first 
replies and all underlying replies. In other words the deleted comment 
recreation with a notice of deletion is now recursive.

Altered design implementations, like "Delete" comes before "Reply to Comments",
"if($file->isFile())" is now "if(is_file($file))", individual padding on 
comments, "Delete" link is now red, number of comments is displayed as:
"Showing 3 Comments (8 counting replies)" for example.

Fixed serious bugs.


Changes by Jeremiah Stoddard 2010-11-06
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altered the unlink line to replace the file contents with the note
"This file has been deleted."

Altered the `readfile()` in line 334 to make a comparison to that note and 
skip the reply/delete links if file contents match the note.

Modified the script to find missing files and recreate them.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-06
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beginning of comment deletion functionality.

Added JavaScript function to display "Options" such as Name, Email, 
Website, etc., when replying.

Added a Password field, used to shore an encrypted password in each 
comment file for later use, such as deleting a comment.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-05
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Made referrer checking stricter to avoid obscure directories created under 
"/comments" via external usage. This happened on Google search cache and 
other external websites that could remotely use the comment system by simply 
including "tildehash.com" in the page name or as a URL query.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added "<s>", "<ul>", "<ol>", "<li>", and "<blockquote>" as supported HTML.
Now removing second queries from referring URLs.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug that caused pages with URLs that contain numbers to include the 
numbers in the permalink.

Fixed a bug that caused the first comment's first reply to have the same 
permalink number as the 11th comment (1/1.txt = 11 & 11.txt = 11).

Moved the reply link out of the "data" variable and into the "read_comments" 
function, a reply link will no longer be written to each comment file.

Made some small layout changes.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-10-23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added a warning message when a comment is posted without an email address.
Added a <noscript> tag to the installation code.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-09-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sort of confused about the comment counting method used for displaying a 
message when a comment has been deleted. There was (is?) a bug that caused it 
to display a "Comment Deleted" message after replies. I believe I've fixed 
this by adding the "deletedcomment" variable back in.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-09-07
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added encryption method for encrypting emails stored in comments; these emails 
are used for notifying a commenter of replies to his/her comment(s).

Added necessary form fields and code for storing encrypted emails and sending 
mail to commenter when another commenter replies to his/her comment(s).


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-07-29
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we strip "../" from $_POST["reply_to"] thus "sanitizing" the value before 
using it. This helps prevent malicious usage (thanks mysterious 89.248.91.145.)

Added additional JavaScript functions for disabling comments, displaying 
comment form on bottom, setting "Comments" field height, disabling "Name" 
field, disabling "E-mail" field, and disabling "Website" field.

$deletedcount removed, $commentcount now used for tracking deleted comments.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-07-28
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added if statement to `mail()` so that if the email given is the same as the 
email used for notification it won't send mail to the notification email.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-07-24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Made the reply link trigger a JavaScript function that replaces it with a 
form to post a reply. This form also only shows the "Name", "E-mail 
Address", and "Website" fields if they don't have content from previous 
usage of the comments in the last month. 

Changed BBCode to normal HTML.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-07-22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added left padding to replies as indention, and added a closing div tag so 
that each reply is in its own div. Permalinks are now based on file 
basenames+subdirectory names.


Changes by Jeremiah Stoddard 2010-07-22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beginnings of a reply system. Need to indent replies. Also, the anchors now 
need to take into account the directory structure: basename("$dir/$file", 
".txt") alone is not sufficient enough to remain unique.


Changes by Jeremiah Stoddard 2010-07-21
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Removed line: header("Content-type: text/javascript"); from near the end of 
script (former line 172) as output already sent by former line 101: 
document.write("\n<form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n");

Added brief installation note

Added additional comments throughout code
