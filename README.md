HashOver 2.0 (development)
===
**HashOver** is a PHP comment system intended as a replacement for services like Disqus. HashOver is free and open source software, under the [GNU Affero General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html). HashOver adds a "comment section" to any website, by placing a few simple lines of JavaScript or PHP to the source code of any webpage. HashOver is a self-hosted system and allows completely anonymous comments to be posted, the only required information is the comment itself.

Required modules/compilation
---
Although most PHP installations include everything HashOver requires by default, depending on your setup you may need to install some modules/extensions and/or ensure PHP was compiled with support for the following modules.

Checking for required modules
---
On UNIX (GNU, BSD, etc) you may list which modules you have installed with this command...
```
php -m
```


HashOver on Windows
---
Windows will be officially supported by HashOver 2.0, there should not be any major issues with using HashOver on Windows. However, HashOver is primarily developed on and for UNIX operating systems, which are the primary operating systems used by the majority of web servers. If you have any issues with HashOver on Windows, please report them.

On Windows the command to list installed modules is...
```
php.exe -m
```


Important differences from version 1.0
---
- `hashover.php` is no longer used in JavaScript tags, the file `/hashover/hashover.js` is used instead.

  So change:

  ```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/hashover.php"></script>
  ```

  To:

  ```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/hashover/hashover.js"></script>
  ```

- HashOver 2.0 is object oriented, many things have changed places and been renamed. For normal users, about the only thing that is important to know is that the `secrets.php` file was merged with the `settings.php` file.


Focus of this release
---
HashOver [version 1.0](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover) consists of code written by [one person](http://tildehash.com/?page=author) over the course of five years, come March the 29th 2014. Moreover, HashOver was my first serious use of JavaScript and my first PHP project of such complexity. Those two facts should trigger obvious concerns about HashOver's performance, efficiency, and security. With that in mind, version 2.0 will be the next release, skipping 1.x releases all together, and will focus on improving nothing but the following areas.

- Security
- Performance [[#61](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/61)]
- Code efficiency [[#62](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/62)]
- Deployment
- Data storage format [[#32](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/32)]
- Backwards and forwards compatibility
- Operating system support
- Aesthetics and graphics [[#4](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/4)] [[#11](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/11)]
- Graphic scalability on (*x<sup>i</sup>*)HDPI displays [[#4](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/4)] [[#11](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/11)]
- Code readability [[#62](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/62)] [[#63](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/63)]
- Bug fixes

This means the possibility of new features in version 2.0 is next to null, and contributions via GitHub and/or e-mail that add new features will be rejected, at least for the time being. Improvements to existing functionality and aesthetics will be accepted. New features will be accepted and available in version 2.x releases.

support right to left languages
---
If your language have a right to left (RTL) direction, you should change style from default to default_rtl, in my case my language is persian(fa) so I choose "fa" for language and "default_rtl" for style.
